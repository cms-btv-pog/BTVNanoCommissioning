BTVNanoCommissioning
====================

This page documents the setup of the [BTV Run 3 commissioning framework](https://github.com/cms-btv-pog/BTVNanoCommissioning/tree/master). This framework is based on [coffea](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/) and using [btvnano](https://btv-wiki.docs.cern.ch/SoftwareAlgorithms/PFNano/) as input. The framework is also used as frontend for the btv automation task [autobtv](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-analysis/btv/software-and-algorithms/autobtv)

This framework is based on [coffea processor](https://coffeateam.github.io/coffea/concepts.html#coffea-processor). Each workflow can be a separate **processor** file in the `workflows`, creating the mapping from `PFNano` to the histograms as `coffea` file or creating `.root` files by saving awkward arrays. Workflow processors can be passed to the `runner.py` script along with the fileset these should run over. Multiple executors can be chosen
(`iterative` - one by one, `futures` - multiprocessing. Scale out to clusters depend on facilities, see the details in [scale-out sites](./scaleout.md)). Obtain the histograms as plot(`.pdf`) or save to template `.root` file with dedicated scripts.

Current working in progress [issues](https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-btv-coordination/tasks/-/issues/?label_name%5B%5D=Software%3A%3A%20BTVnano%20%26CommFW)

The minimum requirement commands are shown in follow, specified the selections, datataset, campaign and year
```
python runner.py --workflow ttsemilep_sf --json metadata/test_bta_run3.json --campaign Summer22EERun3 --year 2022
```

More options for the runner can be done:


```bash markdown-code-runner
python runner.py -h
```
